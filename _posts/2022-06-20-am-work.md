### Begin munging polar exports
* Eventually, I'll need to automate processing raw csv exports from Polar
* Initially, just record what I do to get something good enough to do a little learning

### Goals are contradictory
1. initally, just distinguish between walking, cycling, sitting, SUP, swimming
1. Later evaluate the quality of the exercise

### Ultimate
1. Give guidance during exercise about the expected quality so that one can back off or workhardwer to reach a trqining goal, see a danger sign, etc.
1. For exaple, recovery in hot weather is takes longer. Cam we gove appropriate advice?
1. can we integrated scale readings before and afer workouts?
1. Can we avoid 'workouts' and just measure the day's activity, recovery, etc?
1. Eventually, devices will include HRV data. 
1. Will we be able to predict day +1 hrv from day 0 data? I suspect variance+duration+some measure of recvovery time will be useful.

### Today
1. remove everything but speed, distance, HR, elevatioon
1. Add labels for walking, riding, sitting
1. create training set and ____ -- mknimal
1. evaluate prei
1. enter hrv, weight and temp data by hand
